# Scir
It is a messaging programme written in the Rust programming language.
The Project was inspired by tsoding's project 4at, and a lot of the initial code is based on his project.

# Usage
The programme is still incomplete at the moment so using it is not easy.
First To use it you have to manually change the ip in the client.rs file, this will hopefully change in the future,

Then compile the programme.
``` bash
cargo build
```

Then run the server binary.
``` bash
cargo run --bin=server
```

Then run the client
``` bash
cargo run --bin=client
```
